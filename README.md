# SwiftTechnicalTaskVenuesApp
Eventogy technical task, to find most popular places nearby using FourSquare API.

### Task:

Create an app that allows a user to enter a place name, submit, and then view the recommended or popular venues nearby.
The venues are provided by the FourSquare API which you can integrate with.

### Instructions:

The demonstration app should take a minimum viable product approach to show how you approach the problem with exceptional production quality code and organization (but without spending too much of your time). 

You will need to sign up as a Foursquare developer and create an app in order to use their services. Feel free to use the Foursquare public token available from trying out the API endpoints on the foursquare developer website (e.g. https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/users/search -> ’Try it out’).

### Rules:
1. Your code must be written in Swift (for iOS) and should use the most modern/recent conventions and dependencies
2. Feel free to use Google, Stack Overflow, and any other websites or tutorials for inspiration but ensure the submitted code is your own solution
3. Your code must compile and run as instructed in your readme
4. Your code must be provided in a github repository and you should frequently check-in your progress to demonstrate your incremental approach and process
5. When you submit your code you must send a summary (or have it as your readme.md) explaining the approach you have taken
6. Your code must be unit tested (optional)
